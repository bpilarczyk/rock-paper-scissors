Rock-Paper-Scissors - JS Console game

Fun fact! In some (human) languages, the order of the tools used in the game is different.
Notably: 
1. German: Schere, Stein, Papier => "Scissors, Rock, Paper"
2. Polish: Papier, kamień, nożyce => "Paper, Rock, Scissors"
3. Italian: Carta, Forbice, Sasso => "Paper, Scissors, Rock"

Whereas some other languages follow the same order as English
4. Portuguese: Pedra, Papel e Tesoura => "Rock, Paper, and Scissors"
